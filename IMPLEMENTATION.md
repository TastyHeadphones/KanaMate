## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Kana Data Model (`KanaData.swift`)
- Complete set of Japanese kana including:
  - Basic kana (50 sounds)
  - Voiced sounds (が, ざ, だ, ば, etc.)
  - Semi-voiced sounds (ぱ, etc.)
  - Combination sounds (きゃ, しゅ, りょ, etc.)
- Each kana includes romaji, hiragana, and katakana
- Categorized for organized learning

### 2. Spaced Repetition System (`UserProgress.swift`)
- Tracks user performance for each kana
- Implements difficulty scoring
- Calculates next review dates based on performance
- Prioritizes difficult kana for more frequent review
- Persistent storage using UserDefaults

### 3. Main Learning Interface (`ContentView.swift`)
- Clean, minimalistic design with large fonts
- Shows romaji for user to recognize
- ✔️ (Know) and ❌ (Don't Know) buttons
- Immediate kana reveal when user doesn't know
- Audio playback button for pronunciation
- Progress tracking and statistics

### 4. Audio System (`AudioManager.swift`)
- Placeholder implementation for kana pronunciation
- Ready for integration with actual audio files
- Uses system sounds as temporary placeholder

## Learning Flow

1. **Start Session**: App selects kana for review based on spaced repetition algorithm
2. **Show Romaji**: Display Latin transcription to user
3. **User Choice**: User taps ✔️ if they know it, ❌ if they don't
4. **Reveal/Continue**: 
   - If ✔️: Move to next kana, record success
   - If ❌: Show hiragana and katakana, play audio, record difficulty
5. **Progress Tracking**: Update user statistics and next review dates
6. **Repeat**: Continue with next kana in queue

## How to Extend

### Adding Audio Files
1. Add .mp3 files to the app bundle (named by romaji: "a.mp3", "ka.mp3", etc.)
2. Update `AudioManager.playPronunciation()` to load actual audio files
3. Remove placeholder system sound implementation

### Customizing Spaced Repetition
- Modify algorithms in `UserProgress.swift`
- Adjust difficulty calculation logic
- Change review interval calculations

### UI Enhancements
- Add animations in `ContentView.swift`
- Create additional views for settings, detailed stats
- Implement theme customization

### Data Persistence
- Consider migrating from UserDefaults to Core Data for complex queries
- Add data export/import functionality
- Implement user profiles

## Testing
Run tests with: `swift test` (requires Xcode/Swift toolchain)

The test suite covers:
- Kana data loading and validation
- User progress tracking
- Spaced repetition logic
- Success rate calculations

## Deployment Notes
This is a SwiftUI iOS app that requires:
- iOS 15.0 or later
- Xcode 13+ for building
- Swift 5.5+

To build as an actual iOS app, this code needs to be imported into an Xcode project with proper iOS SDK integration.
